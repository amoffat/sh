PBS is a unique subprocess wrapper that maps your system programs to
Python functions dynamically.  PBS helps you write shell scripts in
Python by giving you the good features of Bash (easy command calling, easy
piping) with all the power and flexibility of Python.

```python
from pbs import ifconfig
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

PBS is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.


# Usage

The easiest way (and least magical way) to get up and running is to import pbs
directly or import your program from pbs:

```python
import pbs
print pbs.ifconfig("eth0")

from pbs import ifconfig
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

The alternative way is to import *all* of your system programs by using star
import.  Note that this does not actually import every system program, but
provides a dynamic lookup mechanism.  This usage pattern is suited for one-file
shell scripts:

```python
from pbs import *
print ifconfig("eth0")
print du()
```

There are some important caveats when using star import, and the code will
raise a warning to notify you of such.  Please review the limitations under
the last section "Limitations".

A less common usage pattern is through PBS Command wrapper, which takes a
full path to a command and returns a callable object.  This is useful for
programs that have weird characters in their names or programs that aren't in
your $PATH:

```python
import pbs
ffmpeg = pbs.Command("/usr/bin/ffmpeg")
ffmpeg(movie_file)
```

The last usage pattern is for trying PBS through an interactive REPL.  By
default, this acts like a star import (so all of your system programs will be
immediately available as functions):

    $> python pbs.py


# Examples

## Executing Commands

Commands work like you'd expect.  **Just call your program's name like
a function:**

```python
# print the contents of this directory 
print ls("-l")

# get the longest line of this file
longest_line = wc(__file__, "-L")

# get interface information
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

Note that these aren't Python functions, these are running the binary
commands on your system dynamically by resolving your PATH, much like Bash does.
In this way, all the programs on your system are easily available
in Python.

## Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments also work like you'd expect: they get replaced with the
long-form and short-form commandline option:

```python
# resolves to "curl http://duckduckgo.com/ -o page.html --silent"
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", o="page.html", silent=True)

# or if you prefer not to use keyword arguments, these do the same thing:
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", "-o page.html", "--silent")
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", "-o", "page.html", "--silent")

# resolves to "adduser amoffat --system --shell=/bin/bash --no-create-home"
adduser("amoffat", system=True, shell="/bin/bash", no_create_home=True)

# or
adduser("amoffat", "--system", "--shell /bin/bash", "--no-create-home")
```

## Piping

Piping has become function composition:

```python
# sort this directory by biggest file
print sort(du("*", "-sb"), "-rn")

# print the number of folders and files in /etc
print wc(ls("/etc", "-1"), "-l")
```

## Sudo and With Contexts

Commands can be run within a "with" context.  Popular commands using this
might be "sudo" or "fakeroot":

```python
with sudo:
    print ls("/root")
```

If you need
to run a command in a with context AND call it, for example, specifying
a -p prompt with sudo, you need to use the "_with" keyword argument.
This let's the command know that it's being run from a with context so
it can behave correctly.

```python
with sudo(p=">", _with=True):
    print ls("/root")
```


## Finding Commands

"Which" finds the full path of a program, or returns None if it doesn't exist.
This command is one of the few commands implemented as a Python function,
and therefore doesn't rely on the "which" program actually existing. 

```python
print which("python") # "/usr/bin/python"
print which("ls") # "/bin/ls"
print which("some_command") # None

if not which("supervisorctl"): apt_get("install", "supervisor", "-y")
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are available much like they are in Bash:

```python
print HOME
print SHELL
print PS1
```

You can set enviroment variables the usual way, through the os.environ
mapping:

```python
import os
os.environ["TEST"] = "123"
```

Now any new subprocess commands called from the script will be able to
access that environment variable.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are dynamically generated based on the return code of the command.
This lets you catch a specific return code, or catch all error return codes
through the base class ErrorReturnCode:

```python
try: print ls("/some/non-existant/folder")
except ErrorReturnCode_2:
    print "folder doesn't exist!"
    create_the_folder()
except ErrorReturnCode:
    print "unknown error"
    exit(1)
```

## Commandline Arguments

You can access commandline arguments similar to Bash's $1, $2, etc by using
ARG1, ARG2, etc:

```python
print ARG1, ARG2

# if an argument isn't defined, it's set to None
if ARG10 is None: do_something()
```

You can access the entire argparse/optparse-friendly list of commandline
arguments through "ARGV".  This is recommended for flexibility:

```python
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="PROG")
parser.add_argument("-x", default=3, type=int)
ns = parser.parse_args(ARGV)
print ns.x
```


## Background Processes

Commands can be run in the background with the special _bg=True keyword
argument:

```python
# blocks
sleep(3)
print "...3 seconds later"

# doesn't block
p = sleep(3, _bg=True)
print "prints immediately!"
p.wait()
print "...and 3 seconds later"
```

You can also pipe together background processes!

```python
p = wc(curl("http://github.com/", silent=True, _bg=True), "--bytes")
print "prints immediately!"
print "byte count of github: %d" % int(p) # lazily completes
```

This lets you start long-running commands at the beginning of your script
(like a file download) and continue performing other commands in the
foreground.

## Redirection

PBS can redirect the standard and error output streams of a process to a file. 
This is done with the special _out and _err keyword arguments. You can pass a
filename or a file object as the argument value. When the name of an already 
existing file is passed, the contents of the file will be overwritten.

```python
ls(_out="files.list")
ls("nonexistent", _err="error.txt")
```

PBS can also redirect the error output stream to the standard output stream,
using the special _err_to_out=True keyword argument.

Redirected streams are not available on the Command object, in other words:

```python
ls(_out="foo").stdout == None
sleep(3, _err_to_out).stderr == None
```

## Weirdly-named Commands

PBS automatically handles underscore-dash conversions.  For example, if you want
to call apt-get:

```python
apt_get("install", "mplayer", y=True)
```

PBS looks for "apt_get", but if it doesn't find it, replaces all underscores
with dashes and searches again.  If the command still isn't found, a
CommandNotFound exception is raised.

Commands with other, less-commonly symbols in their names must be accessed
directly through the "Command" class wrapper.  The Command class takes the full
path to the program as a string:

```python
p27 = Command(which("python2.7"))
print p27("-h")
```

The Command wrapper is also useful for commands that are not in your standard PATH:

```python
script = Command("/tmp/temporary-script.sh")
print script()
```

## Limitations

PBS's main limitations come from the use of star import.  If you're interested
as to why these limitations exist, please take a look at the source.  In
general, when using star import:

* Do the import as soon as possible, at the top of the script.
* Do not do the star import on an indented line (so don't do it from within an
if statement, or function, etc)
* (Disabled anyway, but) Do not star import from the Python shell.  If you want
to muck around in a REPL shell, run PBS as a script, which will launch a REPL.
* (Disabled anyway, but) Do not star import from anywhere other than a main 
script.
