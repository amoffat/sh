PBS is a unique subprocess wrapper that maps your system programs to
Python functions dynamically.  PBS helps you write shell scripts in
Python by giving you the good features of Bash (easy command calling, easy piping)
with all the power and flexibility of Python.

```python
from pbs import ifconfig
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

PBS is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.


# Usage

If you're writing a shell-style script, import the following way:

```python
from pbs import *
```

This will make all of your system programs available to the script.
Note that this does not actually import every system program, but
provides a dynamic lookup mechanism.

Or if you just want to import a few system programs:

```python
from pbs import ifconfig, supervisorctl, ffmpeg
```

You can also try out PBS through an interactive REPL:

    $> python pbs.py


# Examples

## Executing Commands

Commands work like you'd expect.  **Just call your program's name like
a function:**

```python
# print the contents of this directory 
print ls("-l")

# get the longest line of this file
longest_line = wc(__file__, "-L")

# get interface information
print ifconfig("eth0")
```

Note that these aren't Python functions, these are running the binary
commands on your system dynamically by resolving your PATH, much like Bash does.
In this way, all the programs on your system are easily available
in Python.

## Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments also work like you'd expect: they get replaced with the
long-form and short-form commandline option:

```python
# resolves to "curl http://duckduckgo.com/ -o page.html --silent"
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", o="page.html", silent=True)

# or if you prefer not to use keyword arguments, these do the same thing:
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", "-o page.html", "--silent")
curl("http://duckduckgo.com/", "-o", "page.html", "--silent")

# resolves to "adduser amoffat --system --shell=/bin/bash --no-create-home"
adduser("amoffat", system=True, shell="/bin/bash", no_create_home=True)

# or
adduser("amoffat", "--system", "--shell /bin/bash", "--no-create-home")
```

## Piping

Piping has become function composition:

```python
# sort this directory by biggest file
print sort(du("*", "-sb"), "-rn")

# print the number of folders and files in /etc
print wc(ls("/etc", "-1"), "-l")
```

## Sudo and With Contexts

Commands can be run within a "with" context.  Popular commands using this
might be "sudo" or "fakeroot":

```python
with sudo:
    print ls("/root")
```

If you need
to run a command in a with context AND call it, for example, specifying
a -p prompt with sudo, you need to use the "_with" keyword argument.
This let's the command know that it's being run from a with context so
it can behave correctly.

```python
with sudo(p=">", _with=True):
    print ls("/root")
```


## Finding Commands

"Which" finds the full path of a program, or returns None if it doesn't exist.
This command is one of the few commands implemented as a Python function,
and therefore doesn't rely on the "which" program actually existing. 

```python
print which("python") # "/usr/bin/python"
print which("ls") # "/bin/ls"
print which("some_command") # None

if not which("supervisorctl"): apt_get("install", "supervisor", "-y")
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are available much like they are in Bash:

```python
print HOME
print SHELL
print PS1
```

You can set enviroment variables the usual way, through the os.environ
mapping:

```python
import os
os.environ["TEST"] = "123"
```

Now any new subprocess commands called from the script will be able to
access that environment variable.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are dynamically generated based on the return code of the command.
This lets you catch a specific return code, or catch all error return codes
through the base class ErrorReturnCode:

```python
try: print ls("/some/non-existant/folder")
except ErrorReturnCode_2:
    print "folder doesn't exist!"
    create_the_folder()
except ErrorReturnCode:
    print "unknown error"
    exit(1)
```

## Commandline Arguments

You can access commandline arguments similar to Bash's $1, $2, etc by using
ARG1, ARG2, etc:

```python
print ARG1, ARG2

# if an argument isn't defined, it's set to None
if ARG10 is None: do_something()
```

You can access the entire argparse/optparse-friendly list of commandline
arguments through "ARGV".  This is recommended for flexibility:

```python
import argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="PROG")
parser.add_argument("-x", default=3, type=int)
ns = parser.parse_args(ARGV)
print ns.x
```


## Background Processes

Commands can be run in the background with the special _bg=True keyword
argument:

```python
# blocks
sleep(3)
print "...3 seconds later"

# doesn't block
p = sleep(3, _bg=True)
print "prints immediately!"
p.wait()
print "...and 3 seconds later"
```

You can also pipe together background processes!

```python
p = wc(curl("http://github.com/", silent=True, _bg=True), "--bytes")
print "prints immediately!"
print "byte count of github: %d" % int(p) # lazily completes
```

This lets you start long-running commands at the beginning of your script
(like a file download) and continue performing other commands in the
foreground.


## Weirdly-named commands

PBS automatically handles underscore-dash conversions.  For example, if you want to call apt-get:

```python
apt_get("install", "mplayer", y=True)
```

PBS looks for "apt_get", but if it doesn't find it, replaces all underscores with dashes and searches
again.  If the command still isn't found, a CommandNotFound exception is raised.

Commands with other, more uncommonly-named symbols in them must be accessed directly through
the "Command" class wrapper.  The Command class takes the full path to the program as a string:

```python
p27 = Command(which("python2.7"))
print p27("-h")
```

The Command wrapper is also useful for commands that are not in your standard PATH:

```python
script = Command("/tmp/temporary-script.sh")
print script()
```
